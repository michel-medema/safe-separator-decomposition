# PACE 2017

These graphs are not included in this repository, since many of the files are quite large. They are stored in a GitHub repository created for the [PACE challenge](https://github.com/PACE-challenge/Treewidth-PACE-2017-instances). There are two sets: [exact](https://github.com/PACE-challenge/Treewidth-PACE-2017-instances/tree/master/gr/exact) and [heuristic](https://github.com/PACE-challenge/Treewidth-PACE-2017-instances/tree/master/gr/heuristic). The former are smaller graphs meant for computing the exact treewidth, while the latter set consists of larger graphs that are meant for heuristic algorithms. There is also a set of bonus instances that was used in the paper "A safeness condition for minimal separators based on vertex connectivity", which can be found [here](https://github.com/PACE-challenge/Treewidth-PACE-2017-bonus-instances).
